# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction

## What is SQL?

-SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases. It is a standard language for interacting with databases and is used for tasks such as creating, modifying, and retrieving data from a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL allows users to perform various operations on data stored in a relational database, including:

Querying Data: SQL allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables using SELECT statements. You can specify conditions, filter results, and sort the data as needed.

Inserting Data: SQL enables the insertion of new records into a database table using INSERT statements.

Updating Data: You can use SQL UPDATE statements to modify existing records in a database.

Deleting Data: SQL DELETE statements allow you to remove records from a table.

Creating and Modifying Tables: SQL is used to define the structure of a database, including creating tables, specifying column data types, and setting constraints. You can also modify table structures using SQL ALTER statements.

Managing Database Users and Security: SQL can be used to manage user accounts and control access to the database, including granting and revoking permissions.

Aggregating and Analyzing Data: SQL supports aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) and allows for data analysis and reporting.
