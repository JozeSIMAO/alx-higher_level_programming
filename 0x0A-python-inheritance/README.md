##PYTHON INHERITANCE

-In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. It enables you to create a new class (called a "subclass" or "derived class") that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (called a "base class" or "parent class"). This mechanism promotes code reuse and allows you to model relationships between objects more effectively.
