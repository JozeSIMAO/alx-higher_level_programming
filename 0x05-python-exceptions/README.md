##0x05. Python - Exceptions

-Python exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. In other words, they are unexpected or erroneous situations that can arise while a program is running. Exceptions allow you to handle errors and anomalies in a controlled manner rather than letting them crash the program entirely.

When an exceptional situation occurs, Python raises an exception, which is an object representing the specific error that occurred. This exception can then be caught and handled by the program using error-handling mechanisms.
